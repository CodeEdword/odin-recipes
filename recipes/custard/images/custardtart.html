<h3> Ingredients </h3>
<strong> Dough </strong>
<ul>
<li> 1 cup of all-purpose flour </li>
<li> 1 <strong><em>teaspoon</em></strong> of salt </li>
<li> 1/3 cup of water </li>
<li> 1 stick of unsalted butter</li>
</ul>
<strong> Sugar syrup </strong>
<ul>
    <li> 3/4 white sugar </li>
    <li> 1/3 cup water </li>
    <li> 1 tablespoon of water </li>
    <li> 1 cinnamon stick (optional)</li>
    <li> 1 lemon, zested in large strips </li>
</ul>
<strong> Custard Base </strong>
<ul>
    <li> 1/3 cup flour </li>
    <li> 1/4 teaspoon salt </li>
    <li> 1 1/2 cups of milk </li>
    <li> 6 large egg yolks </li>
    <li> 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract </li>
</ul>
<h3> Steps </h3>

<ol>
    <li>Combine flour, salt, and cold water in a 
        bowl. Mix with a wooden spoon until dough 
        just comes together and pulls away from 
        the sides of the bowl. Dough should be 
        sticky; adjust with more flour or water to 
        achieve what's shown in the video.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Transfer dough onto a well-floured surface. 
        Dust a little more flour over the top. Knead 
        for 1 to 2 minutes to form a round. Cover and 
        let rest for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Roll dough into a square about 1/8-inch-thick, 
        dusting with flour as necessary; dough should 
        still be sticky.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Spread 1/3 of the butter over 2/3 of the square 
        using a silicone spatula, leaving a 1/2-inch border. 
        Flip the unbuttered side over the middle of the 
        square and fold the opposite end over it like a 
        letter. Straighten the edges as needed.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Turn dough with a bench scraper to unstick it 
        from the counter; dust with flour. Flip and sprinkle 
        more flour on top. Roll dough into a 1/8-inch-thick 
        rectangle, carefully stretching edges as needed. 
        Spread another 1/3 of the butter over 2/3 of the 
        dough. Fold into thirds. Transfer onto a lined 
        baking sheet and freeze until butter is slightly 
        chilled, about 10 minutes.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Sprinkle dough with flour and roll into a square 
        a little over 1/8-inch-thick. Spread remaining 
        butter over the dough, leaving a 1- to 1 1/2-inch 
        border on the top edge. Dip your finger in water 
        and lightly moisten the unbuttered edge. Roll dough 
        into a log starting from the bottom edge. Dust with 
        more flour and polish the ends as needed. Seal 
        with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2 
        hours, preferably overnight.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Combine sugar, 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon water, 
        cinnamon, and lemon zest in a pot. Boil over medium 
        heat, without stirring, until syrup reaches 210 
        to 215 degrees F (100 degrees C). Remove from 
        heat.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 550 degrees F (288 degrees C). 
        Grease a 12-cup muffin tin.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Whisk flour, salt, and cold milk together very 
        thoroughly in a cold pot. Cook over medium heat, 
        whisking constantly, until milk thickens, about 
        5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool for at 
        least 10 minutes.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Whisk egg yolks into the cooled milk. Add sugar 
        syrup and vanilla extract. Mix until combined. 
        Strain custard into a glass measuring cup.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Unwrap the dough and trim any uneven bits on 
        the ends. Score log into 12 even pieces using a 
        knife; cut through.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Place a piece of dough in each muffin cup. Dip 
        your thumb lightly in some cold water. Press 
        your thumb into the center of the swirl; push 
        dough against the bottom and up the sides of 
        the cup until it reaches least 1/8 inch past 
        the top. Fill each cup 3/4 of the way with 
        custard.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the pastry is 
        browned and bubbly, and the tops start to blister 
        and caramelize, about 12 minutes. Cool tarts 
        briefly and serve warm.</li>
