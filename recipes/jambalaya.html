<h3> Description </h3>
<p>Jambalaya is a one-pot dish that's made with 
    rice, meat or seafood, and vegetables. With 
    French and Spanish influences, jambalaya is 
    quite similar to paella. The name "jambalaya" 
    likely comes from the Provençal word "jambalaia," 
    which means mishmash.
<br>
    Like many Cajun and Creole foods, jambalaya starts 
    with the Cajun holy trinity: a flavor base of onion, 
    bell peppers, and celery. </p>
