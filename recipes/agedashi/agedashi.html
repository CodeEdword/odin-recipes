<h3> Description </h3>
<p>This quick and easy Japanese fried tofu recipe 
    is a great appetizer. Crispy fried cubes of 
    tofu are served with a tasty sauce and chopped 
    green onion.</p>

<h3> Ingredients </h3>
<ul>
<li> 2 cups of water </li>
<li> 2 tablespoons of light soy sauce</li>
<li> 2 tablespoons of mirin </li>
<li> 1 teaspoon of dashi granules </li>
<li> 1/4 cup all-purpose flour </li>
<li> Vegetable oil for frying </li>
<li> 2 green onions </li>
</ul>

<h3> Steps </h3>
<ol>
<li> Place the block of tofu between sheets of 
    paper towels. Set a plate on top; add a 
    3- to 5-pound weight to the plate. Press tofu 
    for 15 minutes; drain and discard the accumulated 
    liquid.</li>
<li> Meanwhile, combine water, soy sauce, mirin, 
    and dashi in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over 
    medium heat. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
<li> Remove weight, plate, and paper towels. Cut 
    tofu into 3/4-inch cubes. Place flour in a 
    bowl and lightly coat tofu with flour.</li>
<li> Heat oil in a heavy pot and fry tofu until 
    golden-brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Fry in batches 
    if necessary so as not to overcrowd the pot. 
    Place fried tofu in a serving dish and pour 
    sauce on top. Sprinkle with green onions.</li>
